            <p>Bheem is an adventurous and fun-loving 9-year-old boy who is gifted with extraordinary superhuman strength. 
              This power is a boon for his village Dholakpur, which is constantly beset by all kinds of pens. Almost all the 
              children of Dolakpur, a majority of the people, as well as Raja Indravarma himself, look up to Bheem for solutions
               to their problems, ranging from mysterious disappearances of some villagers and attacks by wild animals, to drought 
               situations in the village. Bheem has a big heart and he always uses his strength to help those who are poor, wronged
                or needy, and may be considered a little guardian of the villagers and the animals in and around Dholakpur.
                 Bheem is often seen defeating enemies who attack Dholakpur or harm the villagers, like the evil demon Kirmada, the
                  robber Mangal Singh, and the evil witch. Through his valiant acts, Bheem has earned the trust of Dholakpur, and
                   Raja Indravarma. Indravarma regards Bheem so highly that he often discusses major issues regarding the kingdom's 
                   welfare with him and his friends, and they are also sent to neighbouring kingdoms as Indravarma's emissaries. 
                   Bheem is often selected as Dholakpur's representative in many competitions, especially those regarding physical 
                   strength like wrestling, cycling, etc. Bheem loves food and has an insatiable appetite for laddus, which in fact, 
                   give him a surge of energy and make him even stronger than he normally is. These laddus are often stolen by Bheem 
                   from Tuntun's laddu shop, and are also offered by Tuntun's daughter Chutki, much to her mother's anger. This habit of
                    stealing laddus is his only prominent fault. Bheem once even won a competition organised by Tuntun on who could eat 
                    the most laddus. He is also good at most sports, and is fairly intelligent. He is depicted as a fit boy, almost 
                    always wearing nothing but an orange dhoti (loose cloth worn around the groin).

         <p>Tom and Jerry is an American animated franchise and series of comedy short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series centers on a friendship/rivalry (a love-hate relationship) between the title characters Tom, a cat, and Jerry, a mouse. Many shorts also feature several recurring characters.
            In its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 Tom and Jerry shorts for MGM from 1940 to 1958.[1] During this
             time, they won seven Academy Awards for Animated Short Film, tying for first place with Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies 
             with the most awards in the category. After the MGM cartoon studio closed in 1957, MGM revived the series with Gene 
             Deitch directing an additional 13 Tom and Jerry shorts for Rembrandt Films from 1961 to 1962. Tom and Jerry then 
             became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, overtaking Looney Tunes. Chuck Jones then 
             produced another 34 shorts with Sib Tower 12 Productions between 1963 and 1967. Three more shorts were produced, 
             The Mansion Cat in 2001, The Karate Guard in 2005, and A Fundraising Adventure in 2014, making a total of 164 shorts.

            It centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three kindergarten-aged girls with superpowers. The girls all live
             in the fictional city of Townsville with their father and creator, a scientist named Professor Utonium, and are

          <p>Courage the Cowardly Dog is an American animated horror comedy television series created by John R. Dilworth for Cartoon Network and the eighth of the Cartoon Cartoons. It was produced by Dilworth's own animation studio at Stretch Films and distributed by Warner Bros. The title character is a pink, anthropomorphic dog who lives with an elderly couple in a farmhouse in the middle of "Nowhere". In each episode, the trio are thrown into bizarre and frequently disturbing misadventures, often involving the paranormal or supernatural. The series is known for its dark, surreal humor and atmosphere.
           Dilworth pitched the series to Hanna-Barbera's animated shorts showcase What a Cartoon! and a pilot titled "The
            Chicken from Outer Space" aired on Cartoon Network on February 18, 1996.[1] The segment was nominated for an Academy
             Award, but lost to Wallace and Gromit's A Close Shave. The short was greenlit to become a series, which premiered 
             on November 12, 1999, and ended on November 22, 2002, with four seasons each consisting of thirteen episodes. During
              its run, the series was nominated for three Golden Reel Awards and one Annie Award. Merchandise based on the series
               has also been produced, such as home media releases, toys, and clothing.
